# <h1><b>** Don't Buy MyJ2C **</b></h1>
# OpenMyJ2C
Fake JNIC native obfuscator that sales for 8000CNY ~= 1000USD (The dev team said they spend 7000USDT to buy the JNIC source code)
# Notice
This source code can't be compile and run, you have to fix a few bugs<br>
It has almost the same security and performance as JNIC<br>
